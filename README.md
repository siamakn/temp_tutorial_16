In **FAIRmat tutorial 16**, you'll learn how to use **NOMAD** to manage and organize your materials-science research data. Whether you are working with computational or experimental data, NOMAD's graphical user interface makes it easy to upload, share, explore, and analyze your data. We will also focus on using NOMAD to improve collaboration on your research projects and to ensure that your data align with the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

## What you'll do:
- 🔍 **Search and filter** through more than 19 million records using criteria such as materials, properties, or methods.  
- 📊 **Explore data records** and gain insights from the rich metadata structured in NOMAD's data model.  
- 📥 **Upload raw data files** and inspect the extracted data structured in NOMAD’s data model.  
- 🌐 **Visualize your data** directly in your browser, share them with collaborators, and publish them on NOMAD.  
- 🗂️ **Create a dataset** and simulate publishing it with a DOI.  
- 📖 **Document your research** with electronic lab notebooks (ELN) using NOMAD’s built-in templates.  
- 🛠️ **Create custom ELN templates** (demo).  
- 🛠️ **Write a custom parser** for tabular data, such as `.csv` or `.xls` files (demo).  

## At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Efficiently **search, filter, and explore materials-science data** in NOMAD.  
- Manage, upload, and share your research data using NOMAD.  
- Publish your datasets with DOIs to ensure **accessibility and reusability**.  
- Use the **NOMAD ELN functionality** to document your research.  
- Understand the essentials of creating custom templates and parsers for your research data.
