You can organize your uploads and individual entries by grouping them into common datasets, making it easier to manage related data.

Datasets have no influence on the processing of data and are used to reference a collection of data and users can get a DOI for their datasets. 

User created datasets exist in the “Your datasets page” page. You can reach there by clicking on **Datasets** in the **PUBLISH** menu.

Here you can view a list of all your created datasets with their relevant information and assign them a DOI.

### Task 1: Group your entires into a Dataset

**Step 1:** In the uploads page, click on `EDIT AUTHOR METADATA OF ALL ENTRIES` button. This will add all the Entries in the upload to the dataset.

Alternatively, if you would like to add selected entries from your Upload, click on the check box next to the entries you would like to add, then click on <img src="images/change_name_icon.png" alt="Change Name Icon" width="20"> to open the EDIT AUTHOR METADATA window for the selected entries only.

**Step 2:** In the Datasets section, you have two options:
    - Create a new dataset: If the dataset you want to group your entries under doesn't exist yet, you can create one here.
    - Search for an existing dataset: If the dataset already exists, you can search for it by name or other attributes.

**Step 3** Once you've selected or created the appropriate dataset, click `ADD ENTRY TO NEW DATASET` 

**Step 4:** Click on SUBMIT to to group your entries under that dataset.
