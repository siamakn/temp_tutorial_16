Properties of a good dopant:
This list was presented by Seth Marder during the Fpi14 conference in Berlin. 

1. Complete and clean ET to (from) transport material from (to) dopant 
a. Dopant IE (EA) should be as low (high) as possible
b. Dopant should form stable ions
c. Dopant molecule and ions sould not be prone to side reactions
2. Doping can be spatially localized
a. Large dopant molecules to avoid diffusion
3. Dopant ions should not trap carriers on the nearby molecules
a. Large dopant species to minimize Coulombic effects
4. Ideally suitable for both vapor and solution deposition
5. Ideally should be easy to handle in air.
a. But not generally achievable for low IE n-dopants
